You use VBTree to create tree structures that represent hierarchical organizations
of information. 

In such structures, each tree node has exactly one parent tree
(except for the root tree, which has no parent) and can have multiple children. 
Each VBTree object in the structure has a context associated with it; this context
includes some program-defined data.

## Usage

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements

## Installation

VBTree is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

    pod "VBTree"
