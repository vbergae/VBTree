/**
 You use VBTree to create tree structures that represent hierarchical organizations
 of information. 
 
 In such structures, each tree node has exactly one parent tree
 (except for the root tree, which has no parent) and can have multiple children. 
 Each VBTree object in the structure has a context associated with it; this context
 includes some program-defined data.
